# 🔒 Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep pyDeprecate and its users safe! We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities.

## 📦 Supported Versions

Security updates are typically provided for the **latest stable release** of the project.

| Version                  | Supported        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| >= 0.3.0                 | ✅ Yes           |
| < 0.3.0                  | ❌ No            |

> 💡 **Tip:** Always use the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report security vulnerabilities through one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred) — Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the repository's Security tab
2. **Private/Direct contact** — Email the project maintainer (Borda) directly if their contact information is available via GitHub profile.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description** — A clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact** — What could an attacker potentially do?
- **Steps to reproduce** — Detailed steps to demonstrate the issue
- **Affected versions** — Which versions are impacted?
- **Suggested fix** — If you have one (optional but appreciated)

### What to Expect

After you submit a report:

| Timeline   | Action                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 48 hours   | Acknowledgment of your report                           |
| 1-2 weeks  | Initial assessment and severity determination           |
| Ongoing    | Updates on fix progress                                 |
| Upon fix   | Credit in release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)   |

> 🙏 We appreciate your patience. Open source maintainers often work on projects in their spare time.
